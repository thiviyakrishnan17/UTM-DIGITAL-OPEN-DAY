# UTM Digital Open Day 2025 — Industry Talks

I had the opportunity to attend two insightful industry talks during the UTM Digital Open Day 2025.

The sessions on **Information Systems** and **Digital Infrastructure & Data Engineering** offered valuable industry perspectives on how digital services and data-driven systems support operations at UTM. The talks gave concrete examples of real-world applications, best practices, and the kinds of problems teams solve when building campus-scale digital services.

In addition, the interactive booths gave us the chance to explore UTM Digital services, technologies, and ongoing initiatives up close — a great way to connect theory with practice.

Overall, it was a meaningful learning experience that enhanced my understanding of digital transformation in a real-world setting.
